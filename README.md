# Ninety Nine Scala Problems

This repo is based on the ninety nine scala problems replicated here: http://aperiodic.net/phil/scala/s-99/

## Purpose of this Repo/Project

This project provides an unimplemented function and an associated unit test.

For each problem, uncomment the associated unit test, (which should fail) and then implement the function to get the test to pass.

### Running the tests

So you don't have to keep running:

> sbt test

In a terminal, navigate to the repo directory then run:

> sbt ~test

Which will keep re-running the tests automatically each time a code change is identified.
