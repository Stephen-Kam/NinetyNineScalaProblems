# Ninety Nine Scala Problems

This repo is based on the ninety nine scala problems replicated here: http://aperiodic.net/phil/scala/s-99/

## Purpose of this Repo/Project

This project provides the start of the function and an associated unit test.
As you progress through the problems uncomment the associated test.

So you don't have to keep running:

> sbt test

In a terminal, navigate to the repo directory then run:

> sbt ~test

Which will keep re-running the tests automatically each time a code change is identified.
